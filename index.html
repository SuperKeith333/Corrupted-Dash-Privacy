  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>I, SuperKeithDev, respect your privacy and am committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy describes how information is collected and used in my mobile game <strong>Corrupted Dash</strong>, which is directed toward children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>2. Information I Collect</h2>
  <p>I do <strong>not collect any personal information</strong> from users of the game.</p>
  <p>However, the game uses third-party services that may collect <strong>non-personal information</strong>, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and basic technical info</li>
    <li>Crash logs</li>
    <li>Country-level location</li>
    <li>General app usage</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Advertising (AdMob by Google)</h2>
  <p><strong>Corrupted Dash</strong> uses <strong>AdMob by Google</strong> to show <strong>non-personalized ads</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ads are <strong>child-appropriate</strong> and <strong>tagged for child-directed treatment</strong> under COPPA.</li>
    <li>No user tracking or behavioral ad targeting is used.</li>
    <li>All ads comply with Google Play’s Families Policy.</li>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This game is designed for users under 13. I do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If I become aware that I have unknowingly collected personal data from a child, I will delete it as quickly as possible.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>I do not store or manage any user data myself. Any non-personal data is handled securely by third-party services (e.g., AdMob) in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. If any changes are made, the new version will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
